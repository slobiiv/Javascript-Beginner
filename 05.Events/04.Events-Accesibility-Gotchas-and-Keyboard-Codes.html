  <!-- 
  Quick note on accessibility, and keeping our websites accessible to anybody who wants to use them,
  no matter what maybe disability they might have, or what input are device they have, 
  or what situation they're currently in, it should still be a usable website. 
  And HTML by itself, if you mark it up correctly, is very accessible.

  What happens often is us JavaScript developers come in here and goof it up for everybody.
  And we make these things that only work with the mouse, or aren't accessible to anybody.

  - So what we want to do here is just go over a couple of common pitfalls that happen in JavaScript.

  * The first is :
        The difference between buttons and links.
          - Buttons are to be used for actions that happen inside of an application or website.
          - Links are used to change the page.
  * The second is:
        Things that are not keyboard accessible, should not have clicks registered on them unless you need to.
          - There certainly are valid use cases for clicking on a photo:
            a) Make it larger, draw on the photo, zoom it, click and drag :
            * now, I can tab through all of my everything on browser here but I can't click on that photo 
            with only my keyboard
            ********* Solution for image is to put it inside button with "tabindex=0"
            ********* Solution is to give your DIV or other element a "role = 'button'" and "tabindex = 0"
                      So that people can tab to it with their keyboards
            ********* Now you can tab through and focus on each thing
            <div role="button" tabindex="0"></div>
            <button>
              <img tabindex="0" />
            </button>
  -->
  <script>
    /* if I focus this image here and hit my enter key, unlike some other buttons and things like that. It still will not trigger a click. If That's the case you have to go back to your JavaScript, and you also have to grab this event listener. This is how Wes would manage: */
    const photo = document.querySelector('.photo');
    /* How do I then only listen for the enter key on here? */
    function handlePhotoClick(event) {
      if (event.type === 'click' || event.key === 'Enter') {
        console.log('You clicked the photo');
        console.log(event.key);
      }
      // http://keycode.info/
    }
    photo.addEventListener('click', handlePhotoClick);
    photo.addEventListener('keyup', handlePhotoClick);
  </script>
