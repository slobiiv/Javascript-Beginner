      *That information is hidden away in the EVENT OBJECT. 
      *To access the event object, we modify our CALLBACK function, or our handler("handleBuyButtonCLick"), to accept a paremeter that is the EVENT. So when we define our (Callback)function, we can put a parameter here and call it "event".*
