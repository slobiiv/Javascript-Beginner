    /*
      When you write HTML and vire it in the browser, the browser turns your HTML into something called DOM - Document Object Model.
      The DOM is represented in a tree that looks very much like HTML.

      Global Scope in the browser is called - window.
      Window is where all f our global variables are stored as well as helpful properties like, -location, -innerWidth ...
      You can think of the window as everything about the currently open window, including the browser bar, the tabs, the scrollbars - all of the stuff about your actual browser window is generally stored inside of the window object.

      Document -document is responsible for everything from the doctype, opening HTML tag...
      The entire document is going to be accessible to us via the "document" key word.
      (#document - in console highlights the entire page; whole document)
      Navigator - navigator is just sort of a higher level thing that gives you information about not just the browser, but the device itself, the device that it's on: -webcam, -audio access, -battery level, -GPS coordinates... Things that are sort of device specific will live in the navigator
