  <!-- Closures are one of the things that comes up a lot on INTERVIEWS -->
  <!-- Closure is the ability to access a parent level scope from a child scope even after the parent function has been terminated.
  //   Closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
  -->
  <script>
    // An illustrative example :
    // Closure creating a function.
    function outer() {
      const outerVar = 'Hey I am outer Var!';

      function inner() {
        const innerVar = 'Hey I am inner Var';
        console.log(innerVar);
        console.log(outerVar);
      }
      // inner(); inner function is able to do a scope lookup, and see the outer. And display both variables
      return inner; // ALWAYS RETURN INNER FUNCTION
    }
    const innerFn = outer(); // this is an example of closure. We don't call function inside but later in time.
    innerFn();
    /* 
    I can stick a function into a variable and then at a later point in time, I have access to that inner function. 
    */



    function createGreeting(greeting = '') {
      const myGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
      return function (name) {
        return `${myGreeting} ${name}`;
      }
    }

    // Q: Why is this(closure) helfpul. Why did I do this in two separate functions?
    // A: Because you can create functions that are based off of whichever greeting you like:

    const sayHello = createGreeting('Hello');
    const sayHey = createGreeting('Hey');
    console.log(sayHello('Wes'));
    console.log(sayHey('Slobo'));
    console.log(sayHello('Kait'));

    /* What is happening here is that when you create this outer function(createGreeting), because we've created a variable(myGreeting) inside of that function, that is then accessed at a lower scope. So we've got inner scope(function (name)), we've got outter scope (function createGreeting(greeting = '')).
    Because our inner scope references a variable that was created in our outer scope,
    that is what is referred to as a CLOSURE. 
    Where we still are able to access our outer variables ,inside of this outer function scope, inside of our inner, even after this function create greeting has been closed.*/



    // Closure creating (private) variables.

    function createGame(gameName) {
      let score = 0;
      return function win() {
        score++;
        return `Your name ${gameName} score is ${score}`;
      }
    }
    const hockeyGame = createGame('Hockey');
    hockeyGame(); // 1
    hockeyGame(); // 2
    hockeyGame(); // 3
    const soccerGame = createGame('Soccer');
    soccerGame(); // 1
    /* What is happenng here is that if function that we create called "win" and we are using a score variable;
    So whenever we create the game, we create an empty score variable
    And then this inner function, whenever we actually run it,
    will increment the score variable that is of the scope will increment the score variable that is of the scope of the outer scope

    Why is that even helpful?
    Well you can maintain multiple games at once.
